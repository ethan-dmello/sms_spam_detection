# SMS Spam Detection Program

This code is a Python script that builds and trains a deep learning model for spam detection in SMS messages using a bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. The model classifies messages as "ham" (non-spam) or "spam" based on their text content. The program uses TensorFlow as the backend for building, training, and evaluating the deep learning model. Within TensorFlow, it specifically uses the Keras API, which is a high-level neural networks API integrated with TensorFlow. For the basis of this project, the program relies on Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, and scikit-learn to process the data, build the deep learning model, and evaluate its performance. The SMS message dataset is loaded directly from a local file rather than being fetched from an external API. The dataset used for this project was taken from Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019).
